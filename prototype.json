protoEngineNotchWait = 5000 //this is how long you must wait between notching the locomotive, in milliseconds. Set it to anything you like.

prototypeMaxNotch = 8 //this is really just in case you have a weird 16 notcher or something, or you want to only allow up to a certain notch. Note that if you do that, the notch set here will be 100% of the locomotive's horsepower. This is not a "you can't make it go all the way up for safety" thing, this is a "be accurate to the prototype" thing. It MUST be set though, if it's undefined the notching system will cease to function!
